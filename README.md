## Features

- **Smooth Media Browsing**: Browse all your local photos and videos smoothly with highly responsive grids, fluid image loading, and fast interactions.
- **Smart On-Device Search**: Secure, offline search powered by on-device MobileCLIP semantic models and optical character recognition (OCR) for prompt-based search.
- **Material 3 Expressive Design**: Modern layout utilizing shape-morphing animations, emphasized variable font weights, and physics-based spring motions.
- **Local Album Management**: Create folders directly in public device storage and manage a dedicated Recycle Bin next to standard folders.
- **Auto-Hiding Pill Dock**: Navigation toolbar that collapses dynamically on down-scroll and re-appears on minor up-scroll to maximize screen space.
- **Telegram Cloud Backup**: Synchronize selected media folders securely to your private Telegram chat using a personal Telegram Bot. Includes Wi-Fi only upload constraints, low-battery pausing, and location metadata stripping for enhanced privacy.
- **Collage Builder**: Select multiple photos to instantly create custom photo collages.
- **Pinned Albums**: Pin your most-used albums to the top for quick access. Long-press any album to pin or unpin it.
- **Private Space**: A biometric-protected vault to keep sensitive photos and videos hidden from the main gallery.
- **Stitch Tool**: Combine multiple images into a single stitched panorama.
- **Exclude Folders**: Hide unwanted folders from your main gallery view while keeping them accessible via search.
